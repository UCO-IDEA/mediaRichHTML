      <p>I learned to read with a Superman comic book. Simple enough, I suppose. I cannot recall which 
        particular Superman comic book I read, nor can I remember which villain he fought in that issue. I 
        cannot remember the plot, nor the means by which I obtained the comic book. What I can remember is 
        this: I was 3 years old, a Spokane Indian boy living with his family on the Spokane Indian 
        Reservation in eastern Washington state. We were poor by most standards, but one of my parents 
        usually managed to find some minimum-wage job or another, which made us middle-class by reservation 
        standards. I had a brother and three sisters. We lived on a combination of irregular paychecks, 
        hope, fear and government surplus food.</p>

  <p class="slide">My father, who is one of the few Indians who went to Catholic school on purpose, was an avid reader 
    of westerns, spy thrillers, murder mysteries, gangster epics, basketball player biographies and 
    anything else he could find. He bought his books by the pound at Dutch's Pawn Shop, Goodwill, 
    Salvation Army and Value Village. When he had extra money, he bought new novels at supermarkets, 
    convenience stores and hospital gift shops. Our house was filled with books. They were stacked in 
    crazy piles in the bathroom, bedrooms and living room. In a fit of unemployment-inspired creative 
    energy, my father built a set of bookshelves and soon filled them with a random assortment of books 
    about the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, the Vietnam War and the entire 23-book series of the 
    Apache westerns. My father loved books, and since I loved my father with an aching devotion, I 
    decided to love books as well. </p>
  <p class="slide">I can remember picking up my father's books before I could read. The words themselves were mostly 
    foreign, but I still remember the exact moment when I first understood, with a sudden clarity, the 
    purpose of a paragraph. I didn't have the vocabulary to say "paragraph," but I realized that a 
    paragraph was a fence that held words. The words inside a paragraph worked together for a common 
    purpose. They had some specific reason for being inside the same fence. This knowledge delighted 
    me. I began to think of everything in terms of paragraphs. Our reservation was a small paragraph 
    within the United States. My family's house was a paragraph, distinct from the other paragraphs of 
    the LeBrets to the north, the Fords to our south and the Tribal School to the west. Inside our 
    house, each family member existed as a separate paragraph but still had genetics and common 
    experiences to link us. Now, using this logic, I can see my changed family
    as an essay of seven paragraphs: mother, father, older brother, the deceased sister, my younger 
    twin sisters and our adopted little brother. </p>
  <p class="slide">At the same time I was seeing the world in paragraphs, I also picked up that Superman comic book. 
    Each panel, complete with picture, dialogue and narrative was a three-dimensional paragraph. In one 
    panel, Superman breaks through a door. His suit is red, blue and yellow. The brown door shatters 
    into many pieces. I look at the narrative above the picture. I cannot read the words, but I assume 
    it tells me that "Superman is breaking down the door." Aloud, I pretend to read the words and say, 
    "Superman is breaking down the door." Words, dialogue, also float out of Superman's mouth. Because 
    he is breaking down the door, I assume he says, "I am breaking down the door." Once again, I 
    pretend to read the words and say aloud, "I am breaking down the door" In this way, I learned to 
    read. </p>
  <p class="slide">This might be an interesting story all by itself. A little Indian boy teaches himself to read at an 
    early age and advances quickly. He reads "Grapes of Wrath" in kindergarten when other children are 
    struggling through "Dick and Jane." If he'd been anything but an Indian boy living on the 
    reservation, he might have been called a prodigy. But he is an Indian boy living on the reservation 
    and is simply an oddity. He grows into a man who often speaks of his childhood in the third- 
    person, as if it will somehow dull the pain and make him sound more modest about his talents. </p>

  <p class="slide">A smart Indian is a dangerous person, widely feared and ridiculed by Indians and non-Indians alike. 
    I fought with my classmates on a daily basis. They wanted me to stay quiet when the non-Indian 
    teacher asked for answers, for volunteers, for help. We were Indian children who were expected to 
    be stupid. Most lived up to those expectations inside
    the classroom but subverted them on the outside. They struggled with basic reading in school but 
    could remember how to sing a few dozen powwow songs. They were monosyllabic in front of their 
    non-Indian teachers but could tell complicated stories and jokes at the dinner table. They 
    submissively ducked their heads when confronted by a non-Indian adult but would slug it out with 
    the Indian bully who was 10 years older. As Indian children, we were expected to fail in the non- 
    Indian world. Those who failed were ceremonially accepted by other Indians and appropriately pitied 
    by non-Indians.</p>
  
<div class="row">  <p>I refused to fail. I was smart. I was arrogant. I was lucky. I read books late into the night, 
    until I could barely keep my eyes
    open. I read books at recess, then during lunch, and in the few minutes left after I had finished 
    my classroom assignments. I read books in the car when my family traveled to powwows or basketball 
    games. In shopping malls, I ran to the bookstores and read bits and pieces of as many books as I 
    could. I read the books my father brought home from
    the pawnshops and secondhand. I read the books I borrowed from the library. I read the backs of 
    cereal boxes. I read the newspaper. I read the bulletins posted on the walls of the school, the 
    clinic, the tribal offices, the post office. I read junk mail. I read auto-repair manuals. I read 
    magazines. I read anything that had words and paragraphs. I read with equal
    parts joy and desperation. I loved those books, but I also knew that love had only one purpose. I 
    was trying to save my life.</p>

</div> <p class="span4">Despite all the books I read, I am still surprised I became a writer. I was going to be a 
    pediatrician. These days, I write novels, short stories, and poems. I visit schools and teach 
    creative writing to Indian kids. In all my years in the reservation school system, I was never 
    taught how to write poetry, short stories or novels. I was certainly never taught that Indians 
    wrote poetry, short stories and novels. Writing was something beyond Indians. I cannot recall a 
    single time that a guest teacher visited the reservation. There must have been visiting teachers. 
    Who were they? Where are they now? Do they exist? I visit the schools as often as possible. The 
    Indian kids crowd the classroom. Many are writing their own poems, short stories and novels. They 
    have read my books. They have read many other books. They look at me with bright eyes and arrogant 
    wonder. They are trying to save their lives. Then there are the sullen and already defeated Indian 
    kids who sit in the back rows and ignore me with theatrical precision. The pages of their notebooks 
    are empty. They carry neither pencil nor pen. They stare out the window. They refuse and resist. 
    "Books," I say to them. "Books," I say. I throw my weight against their locked doors. The door 
    holds. I am smart. I am arrogant. I am lucky. I am trying to save our lives.
